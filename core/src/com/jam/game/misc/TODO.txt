1) Re-factor the code...to much trash

2) Fix the strange camera bugs...we shouldn't have to reload the screen height oninit for the FitViewPort to work

3) DO THE SCORE!

4) Add static lights to some of the platforms

5) Add lantern objects that will increase light dist for n amount of time

6) Have n types of hats that have different power ups

7) Add traps




END GAME IDEAS:

1) Maybe make it two players, the player that is higher will control the light, race to see who can go the farthest 

2) Swing points (should fall through, but can swing on)
